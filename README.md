# pygmalion

A proof-of-concept game+engine built on pygame.

##### TODO:
 - isolate particular test game from general mechanics
   - "current game state" to be passed between objects, incl. event loop
   - `pygmalion.py` for engine and `game.py` for game
   - master game object with initialization checklist 
 - stationary camera
 - chunk/tile highlighting (for removed obsolete marker feature)
 - additional ways to render a tile
