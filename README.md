# pygmalion

A proof-of-concept game+engine built on pygame.

###### TODO:
 - divide movement mechanics between sprite and camera
 - isolate particular test game from general mechanics
 - remove floating-point calculations, 'cause you don't really need millionths of pixels (10ths or 16ths, right, but not _that_)
 - isolate the renderer for further GUI/HUD additions
 - cleanup: replace `+` operator with `append`
